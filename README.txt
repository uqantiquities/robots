This template is designed to serve up individual github pages with simple video containers to be displayed on ipads within security enclosures for exhibition. The template also comes with the option to use a "coming soon" holding image or similar instead of the video (commented out by default). Simply comment out the <video> tag in <body> and remove the comment from the <img> tag to use this holding image. You'll also need to upload a relevant image to the root directory of the repo. 
The ipads should be permanently powered and setup to use the hidden UQ wifi network to prevent dropouts. 
Install the kioskpro app and setup to serve the individual github pages for each interactive element.
